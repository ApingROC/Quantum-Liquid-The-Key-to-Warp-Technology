# Quantum-Liquid-The-Key-to-Warp-Technology
As anticipated in our preliminary framework, Quantum Liquid is the medium acting as the force that compresses the sphere lattice, which is then perceived as gravity. This leads to the conclusion that a directed quantum liquid flow could transport sphere clusters
