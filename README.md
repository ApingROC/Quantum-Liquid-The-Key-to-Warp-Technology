# Quantum-Liquid-The-Key-to-Warp-Technology
As proposed in our preliminary framework, Quantum Liquid acts as the medium exerting the force that compresses the sphere lattice, which is then perceived as gravity. This leads to the conclusion that a directed quantum liquid flow could transport sphere clusters.
